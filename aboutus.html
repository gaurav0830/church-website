                        The town of Uppinangady, beautifully situated at the confluence of the Netravati and Kumaradhara
                        rivers,
                        became home to a Catholic community nearly a century ago. With great enthusiasm, a priest from
                        Kokkada,
                        together with Fr. Rozario Sequeira, the missionary priest of Kokkada and Uppinangady, worked for
                        the
                        spiritual needs of the people. Their efforts bore fruit on <b>23rd May 1928</b>, when a new
                        church was blessed
                        and inaugurated by the bishop and was dedicated to St. Philomena.

                    <ul>
                        <li>17th July 1928 – A cemetery was built beside the church.</li>
                        <li>9th January 1929 – A church bell was installed.</li>
                        <li>31st May 1931 – Parish priest’s residence completed.</li>
                        <li>30th July 1931 – A student orphanage was built for school children.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In 1931, the Bethany Sisters established Lourdes Convent to support education. On <b>1st January
                            1932</b>,
                        Uppinangady Church was officially declared an independent parish, and on 8th February 1932, it
                        was included in
                        the Mangalore Diocese Parish Union.

                        latter still continues). With bridges connecting regions, more areas were added to the parish:

                        From the beginning, the faithful had a deep devotion to St. Philomena. Since she was not
                        officially recognized
                        as a saint, the church was renamed <b>Our Lady Virgin of the Poor Church</b> on <b>14th April

                        In 1992, the parish revived the annual St. Philomena Feast. Education and cemetery expansions

                            on 20th Dec 1995).</li>
